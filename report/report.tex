\begin{abstract} % It is so boring that BGP is currently the most important protocol

BGP is currently the most important protocol for insuring the global
connectivity of the Internet. This imposes a great deal of responsibility on
BGP, and creates a number of challenges for it. A primary concern is the
impact of the currently deployed BGP-based techniques, such as traffic
engineering, on the global routing table scalability. In our study we present
a two-plane analysis of the BGP announcements for the last 6 years. First, we
correlate globally announced prefixes to IP allocation data and show how well
ISPs tend to use the allocated address space. Second, we self-correlate BGP
announcement data and show various factors contributing to the routing table
growth. We also document where routing announcements originate around the
world which shows the spread of Internet connectivity around the globe.
