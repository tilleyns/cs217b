\section{Introduction}

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) \cite{Rekhter:1995:RFC1771-BGP} is the critical
infrastructure for Internet routing. The routing protocol operates at the
junction point where independent networks (ASes, or autonomous systems)
exchange network traffic to ensure global connectivity. Because ASes are
separate networking and economic entities, BGP currently operates while
balancing essentially two purposes which are practically orthogonal to one
another. First, it interconnects all ASes in the world. Second, BGP tries to
satisfy a wide variety of ISP-specific routing policies, which are governed by
operating costs, a number of agreement-based and politically-based issues,
network locality, multihoming preferences, and, in some select cases, traffic
connection capacity. 

% These have functioned, mostly together and at times as trade-offs to one
% another, to increase complexity within BGP and to deliver the present level
% of routed Internet traffic -- together with its policy-bound routing
% inefficiencies -- as is seen at this time.

As originally envisioned, a hierarchical and scalable routing table was to
serve as an efficient and streamlined mechanism. However, not foreseen was the
degree to which the limited number of IPv4 addresses ($2^{32}$) and the
increasing number of allocations to users would lead to fractionalization and
finer segmentation of the IP address space. Fragmentation has effectively
flattened portions of the IP address table, rather than preserved the
hierarchical IP address-based routing. Reasons for numerous ``special-case''
announcements include multihoming demands and Internet customers'
implementation of particular traffic engineering to suit any special purposes.
Likewise, individual institutions have grown to need more IP addresses than
originally allocated and received additional address blocks that are
non-adjacent. In either case, the routing table has expanded enormously over
the past ten years, with the table maintaining more entries than a
hierarchical structure would have yielded that worked with strictly
consolidated blocks. Figure~\ref{fig:BGP vs RIR} shows that over the past six
years the number of the global routing table entries more than doubled during
last 6 years. The IP address allocations also doubled in the same period but,
numerically, all new allocated blocks account for less than 18\% of the actual
entries in the BGP routing table. 
% To account for this, correspondingly, the
% Internet has handled an increasing number of transmitted BGP updates to
% propagate these steadily ongoing changes.

There is an interesting aspect to notice with the BGP table growth. While the
routing table has undergone a substantial growth (compared to the number of
new allocated IP space), all the IP space that these announcements cover is
still only a fraction of the total measured IP space that has been allocated.
This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:BGP vs RIR space}, which illustrates that
over time, the amount of dormant IP space -- allocated, but not announced in
routing tables -- has ranged from a little over 1/3 to a little over 1/4 of
the total. Despite the high ratio between the number of announced prefixes in
the BGP table and the number of actually allocated IP blocks (2.24 in 2003 and
3.06 in 2009), the substantial amount of IP space ($\approx$25\%) is still unused.

In this paper we presenting an extensive analysis of the IP allocation and BGP
announcement statistics. First, we present an analysis of the dynamics of IP
address allocation and the recent history of which prefix block sizes are most
popular to allocate to ISPs (Internet Service Providers). We find when IP
prefixes have been allocated, as viewed on a yearly basis, and link this
activity to regions of the world where such allocations have been requested.
We then summarize where the most changes have occurred, which indicate where
the busiest Internet areas around the world are and, more importantly,
identify as well the regions where there has been the most rapid development
of ISP hosting.

Second, we examine the correlation between the global routing table and IP
prefix allocation data. From the common prefix block sizes to allocate, we
show what sized blocks are more typical in the BGP table. On a related note,
we estimate the age, or lifespan, of BGP entries as measured between 2003 and
2009. We present, as before with IP address block allocations, a summary by
geography of which regions of the globe contribute to the BGP table contents
each year. It will be possible to draw some conclusions about a country's
``efficiency'' of its IP space announcement: a measure of how much allocated
IP space on average is routed by one globally announced prefix. We also
discuss a number of factors that contribute to the marked growth in the
routing table.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:data sets}
describes the data sets and methodology used in our study.
Section~\ref{sec:allocations} presents an analysis for IP address allocation
statistics. In Section~\ref{sec:bgp} we analyze the composition of the BGP
table and its changes over time, as well as the longevity and stability of
routing table entries. Finally, we present related work and conclusions in
Sections~\ref{sec:related_work} and \ref{sec:conclusions}, respectively.

% The existing Internet fully relies on the BGP protocol~\cite{Rekhter:1995:RFC1771-BGP} to maintain global connectivity. The key element of the BGP is that each participant (autonomous system, AS) announces its IP prefixes which are propagated to the rest of the ASes by means of the protocol. Although the announced set is generally limited by the address blocks allocated to a particular AS by a Regional Internet Registry (RIR), the AS itself decides the granularity of the announcements. In other words, ASes having only one allocated address block can announce multiple prefixes. The two major reasons for this are traffic engineering and multihoming. The popularity of this prefix splitting can be demonstrated by allocation vs announcement statistics. The number of announced prefixes (160K in 2004~\cite{Meng:2005:IPv4-address} growing 300K in 2009~\cite{::BGP-Reports}) is more than two times the number of allocated IPv4 blocks (65K in 2004, 140K in 2009 respectively). These dynamics cast doubt on global routing scalability.

% As originally envisioned, a hierarchical and scalable routing table was to serve as an efficient and streamlined mechanism. However, not foreseen was how the limited number ($2^{32}$) of IPv4 addresses and alongside the increasing number of allocations to users would lead to fractionalization and finer segmentation of the IP address table. There exist several solutions which attempt to contain the size of the global routing table.  Accompanying the growth of the IP assignments have been aggregation techniques with the intent to gather a group of prefixes under a more general IP prefix. However, Internet customers with particular traffic engineering and multihoming demands have preferred that these guidelines not be implemented. On the other hand, some customers willing to aggregate are not in a position to do so, due to the inability of RIRs to assign a specific requester a contiguous range of IP addresses. Such is the case, for example, with UCLA which has accumulated eight IPv4 address blocks and is forced to announce eight different prefixes (128.97.0.0/16, 131.179.0.0/16, 149.142.0.0/16, 164.67.0.0/16, 169.232.0.0/16, 192.35.210.0/24, 192.35.225.0/24, 192.154.2.0/24). This granular allocation has been one of the major contributors to the growth of the global routing table. An interesting topic to pursue would be to find the average number of allocated blocks assigned to various ASes.
%
% Meng et al.~\cite{Meng:2005:IPv4-address} reported a number of statistics that will serve as a baseline for our project.  These include 1) the number of allocated blocks and 2) the number of announced prefixes. We propose to conduct more detailed research by country and AS granularity on the ratio and correlation between the number of allocated blocks and the announced prefixes within the BGP routing table. Arguably, any attempt to renumber allocations such that they are less fragmented would reduce both the number of allocations and correspondingly the number of prefixes and size of the BGP table. Our analysis will help to establish an upper bound of the potential BGP routing table reduction if an IPv4 renumbering technique were to be implemented. Additionally, this will justify the necessity of effective IPv6 address assignment and reassignment techniques.
